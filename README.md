# JavaStarterProject

JavaStarterProject is a simple Java-based application built using Maven. It includes a basic setup with JUnit 5 for testing. This project serves as a starter template for Java projects, demonstrating how to structure code, write unit tests, and manage dependencies using Maven.

### Project Structure
The project follows the standard Maven directory layout:

```
JavaStarterProject
│
├── pom.xml                   # Maven Project Object Model file
├── src
│   ├── main
│   │   └── java
│   │       └── com
│   │           └── alexrhee
│   │               └── starterproject
│   │                   └── App.java   # Main application class
│   └── test
│       └── java
│           └── com
│               └── alexrhee
│                   └── starterproject
│                       └── AppTest.java  # Unit test class
└── target                    # Compiled bytecode and other 
```
### Prerequisites
Java 8 or higher: Make sure Java is installed and JAVA_HOME is set.
Maven 3.6 or higher: Ensure Maven is installed and configured in your system path.
IDE: (Optional) IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code with the Java Extension Pack.
### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/alexr17/JavaStarterProject.git
cd JavaStarterProject
```
### Building the Project
To build the project, compile the source code, and run the tests, use Maven:

```
mvn clean install
```
This command performs the following:

Clean: Removes the target directory (the build output directory).
Install: Compiles the code, runs the tests, and packages the application.
### Running the Application
After building the project, you can run the main application using the following command:

```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.alexrhee.starterproject.App"
```
This will execute the App.java class, which contains the main method.

### Running Tests
To run the unit tests, use the following Maven command:

```
mvn test
```
This will execute the tests defined in AppTest.java using JUnit 5.

### Debugging
If you need to debug your application or tests, you can use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code. Set breakpoints in your code and run the debugger in your IDE.

Debugging Tests in Visual Studio Code
Open AppTest.java in VS Code.
Set breakpoints by clicking on the left margin next to the line numbers.
Right-click on the test method you want to debug and select Debug Test.
The debugger will pause execution at your breakpoints, allowing you to inspect variables and step through the code.
### Dependencies
The project relies on the following dependencies:

JUnit 5: For unit testing.
These dependencies are managed by Maven and are defined in the pom.xml file.

```
<dependencies>
    <!-- JUnit 5 dependency for testing -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
        <version>5.7.1</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit-jupiter-engine</artifactId>
        <version>5.7.1</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
